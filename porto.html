				<h3>Boba and Vader</h3>
				<p>
					Originally introduced in the Star Wars Holiday Special, <br>
					the bounty hunter Boba Fett made his live-action debut in Star Wars: <br>
					The Empire Strikes Back and immediately proved one of the series' <br>
					most interesting characters. <br>
					In that film, Boba worked with Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, <br>
					and the two even seemingly respected each other, <br>
					even if they didn't necessarily like each other. <br>
					now, we're going to break down just what you need to know <br>
					about Darth Vader and Boba Fett working together. <br>

Throughout the original Star Wars trilogy, <br>
 Darth Vader proved himself willing to murder or hurt anyone <br>
  who dared to disagree with him. <br>
This wasn't the case with Boba, though, who is the quintessential <br>
lone wolf bounty hunter character. <br>
 Their respect for each other may tie into one of Anakin Skywalker's <br>
  most trusted friends: Captain Rex, <br>
  who was a major character in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. <br>
  As Boba and Rex were also clones of Jango Fett, <br>
  this might account for why Darth Vader treated the <br>
  bounty hunter with more respect.<br>

				<h3>Dart Vader Mustafar</h3>
<p>
	The Duel on Mustafar was a confrontation where Anakin Skywalker, <br>
	now the recently apprenticed Sith Lord, Darth Vader, fought his <br>
	former Jedi Master and best friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi, on the planet<br>
	Mustafar in the Outer Rim. After learning of Skywalker's downfall <br>
	 with Grand Master Yoda at the Jedi Temple, Kenobi arrived on Mustafar, <br>
	 where he attempted to reason with the fallen Jedi, not believing the <br>
	 Sith Master known as Darth Sidious, revealed to be Emperor Palpatine, <br>
	 had taken control of Skywalker's mind. However, Vader no longer cared for<br>
	  their friendship, and quickly claimed that Kenobi was his enemy; the pair <br>
	  then ignited their lightsabers and locked blades, fighting through the murder <br>
	  scene in the Mustafarian Mining Complex, where Vader had recently slaughtered <br>
	  the members of the Separatist Council, the legislative branch of the Confederacy <br>
	  of Independent Systems.

				<h3>Vader on Hoth</h3>
<p>
	he Battle of Hoth, also known as the attack on Hoth, <br>
	the assault on Echo Base, or the attack on Echo Base, was a major battle fought <br>
	in 3 ABY and was considered a major victory for the Galactic Empire and the single <br>
	worst battlefield defeat suffered by the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. <br>
	The battle was an Imperial invasion led by Darth Vader, aimed at destroying the Rebel Alliance's <br>
	Echo Base hidden on the remote ice world Hoth and capturing Luke Skywalker. The base's <br>
	location was discovered when a Viper probe droid, deployed by Darth Vader's <br>
	Death Squadron randomly landed on Hoth, convincing the Rebels <br>
	to begin an evacuation of Hoth.</p>
				<br/>
	<p>
		The Imperial attack force consisted of primarily AT-AT walkers, <br>
		commanded by General Maximilian Veers.<br>
		 His army was tasked with destroying Echo Base's main power<br>
		  generator to allow orbital bombardment of <br>
		 the planet and for Darth Vader to land on the planet.<br>
		  Spearheading the defense of the generator was <br>
		 Rogue Squadron, manning snowspeeders, commanded by Luke Skywalker,<br>
		  renowned for being the pilot who <br>
		 destroyed the first Death Star. The snowspeeders however did not<br>
		  have the necessary firepower to bring <br>
		 down the walkers, so Skywalker suggested an alternative tactic <br>
		 to trip up the walkers with the tow cables <br>
		 issued to every snowspeeder.

				<h3> Lord VADER</h3>
<p>
	Darth Vader is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. <br>
	The character is the primary antagonist in the original trilogy and, <br>
	 as Anakin Skywalker, is a primary protagonist in the prequel trilogy.<br>
	  Star Wars creator George Lucas has collectively referred to the first <br>
	  six episodic films of the franchise as "the tragedy of Darth Vader".<br><br><br>

Originally a slave on Tatooine, Anakin is a Jedi prophesied to bring <br>
balance to the Force. He is lured to the dark side of the Force by Palpatine <br>
and becomes a Sith lord, assuming the title Darth Vader. After a lightsaber <br>
battle with his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, in which he is severely injured, <br>
Vader is transformed into a cyborg. He then serves the Galactic Empire as its <br>
chief enforcer. Vader ultimately redeems himself by saving his son, Luke Skywalker, <br>
and killing Palpatine, sacrificing his own life in the process.<br>
 He is also the secret husband of Padmé Amidala, biological father of Princess Leia, <br>
 and maternal grandfather of Kylo Ren.

				<h3>Lord VADER comes again</h3>
<p>
	Upon transforming into Darth Vader, he became ruthless, showing no apparent mercy <br>
	to his enemies, occasionally killing his own officers for their failures, and remorselessly <br>
	 imparting torture to accomplish his goals. Having lost all that he cared about by his own hand, <br>
	 the heartbroken and self-loathing Sith only showed a fierce dedication to the Emperor,<br>
	  whose orders he would execute with steadfast devotion, no matter the task.<br><br><br>

Claiming not to feel regret, and yet haunted by his past, and the screams of his wife,<br>
 he was determined to never talk about his old life, and detested all that reminded him of <br>
 his past self (whom he deemed to be weak). He dared not remember such period of life, <br>
 which he hated; indeed, through the use of the dark side, he kept his memories as Anakin Skywalker buried<br>

				<h3>Lord VADER's Assault on Tantive IV</h3>
<p>
Nineteen years after the formation of the Galactic Empire, the galaxy is in a state of <br>
civil war. The Rebel Alliance has won their first major victory by stealing plans to the <br>
Galactic Empire's secret weapon, the Death Star. Hoping that the stolen plans can save her <br>
people and restore freedom to the galaxy, Princess Leia Organa, who is in custody of <br>
the stolen plans attempts to race home aboard the Tantive IV. However, her ship is <br>
intercepted by the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer Devastator over the desert planet of Tatooine.<br>
Princess Leia is captured by the Galactic Empire. <br><br><br>

Imperial stormtroopers manage to board the ship, <br>
and after defeating the small number of guards defending the ship,<br>
 the Sith Lord Darth Vader arrives to assess the damage. Vader is outraged and questions<br>
  Captain Antilles, whom he eventually strangles and kills. Hiding on the ship, <br>
  Princess Leia is spotted by stormtroopers. They shoot her with a stun blast and<br>
   bring her before Vader. However, before being detained, Leia was able to record a holographic <br>
   message with the help of R2-D2, and assigned the droid the responsibility of taking <br>
   the message to a Jedi-in-hiding on Tatooine. Vader orders a message be sent <br>
   to the Imperial Senate, informing them that the ship was destroyed, with everyone on<br>
    board killed. R2-D2 and C-3PO use an escape pod in order to escape the ship and <br>
	reach the planet of Tatooine below<br>

				<h3>VADER goes Flying</h3>
<p>
	Obi-Wan, on the other hand, was destined to meet with Darth Vader. <br>
	 After a short duel with his former Padawan, Obi-Wan sacrifices<br>
	  himself, thus becoming one with the Force and allowing Luke and<br>
	   the others to escape. Horrified and angered having witnessed <br>
	   Obi-Wan's demise at the hands of Vader, Luke takes his final<br>
	    blasts at the stormtroopers and dashes onto the Millennium Falcon.<br>

After fighting a squadron of TIE fighters, the Millennium <br>
Falcon meets the Rebel Alliance on Yavin 4, and the <br>
information in R2-D2 is turned over. General Dodonna plans<br>
 the attack on the Death Star, an attack so audacious <br>
 as to receive an unenthusiastic reaction from the pilots.<br>
  To add to Luke's dismay, Han leaves after receiving his reward.<br><br>


Rebel fighters approach the Death Star.<br>

The Rebel strike force begins its attack on the Death Star, <br>
as the space station approaches the Rebel base on Yavin 4. <br>
A group of starfighters assaults a trench on the Death Star's <br>
surface to hit the station's vulnerable spot before it can destroy<br>
 the Alliance's base. During this, most of the Rebel craft, <br>
 including Luke's friend Biggs Darklighter, are picked off by Imperial <br>
 fighters led by Darth Vader. Just as Vader opens fire on Luke from <br>
 his personal TIE Advanced fighter, Han returns in the Millennium Falcon<br>
  and attacks the Imperials, resulting in Vader's ship getting <br>
  knocked out of the trench. Luke, aided by the voice of Kenobi <br>
  and guided by the Force, accurately fires two proton torpedoes <br>
  into a small exhaust port leading to the Death Star's reactor, <br>
  and the battle station explodes.

The few remaining ships (those of Wedge Antilles, Luke, Han, and a Y-wing Pilot) <br>
return to Yavin 4 and a victory celebration commences, complete with medals for <br>
the heroes, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, presented by Princess Leia.<br/><a href="#" target="_BLANK"></a>

				<h3>VADER on Death Star</h3>
<p>
	The original Death Star's completed form appears in the original Star Wars film, <br>
	 known as the DS-1 Orbital Battle Station, or Project Stardust in Rogue One; <br>
	 before learning the true name of the weapon, the Rebel Alliance referred to <br>
	 it as the "Planet Killer". Commanded by Governor Tarkin, it is the Galactic<br>
	  Empire's "ultimate weapon", a huge spherical battle station 120 kilometers <br>
	  in diameter capable of destroying a planet with one shot of its superlaser.<br>
	   The film opens with Princess Leia transporting the station's schematics <br>
	   to the Rebel Alliance to aid them in destroying the Death Star.<br>
To mark the Death Star being fully operational, Tarkin orders the<br>
Death Star to destroy Leia's home world of Alderaan in an attempt <br>
to press her into giving him the location of the secret Rebel headquarters<br>
she gives them the location of Dantooine which housed a now-deserted<br>
Rebel base, but Tarkin has Alderaan destroyed anyway as a demonstration <br>
of the Empire's resolve. Later, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, <br>
Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, and R2-D2 are pulled aboard the station by a <br><br>
tractor beam, where they discover and manage to rescue Princess Leia.<br>
 As they make their escape, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself whilst duelling <br>
 Darth Vader, enabling the others to flee the station. Later, Luke returns <br>
 as part of a fighter force to attack its only weak point: a ray-shielded <br>
 particle exhaust vent leading straight from the surface directly into its <br>
 reactor core. Luke is able to successfully launch his X-wing fighter's <br>
 torpedoes into the vent, impacting the core and triggering a catastrophic <br>
 explosion, which destroys the station before it can use its superlaser <br>
 weapon to annihilate the Rebel base on Yavin 4.

				<h3>Vader visits Death Star</h3>
<p>
	Sometime after the events of The Empire Strikes Back, Darth Vader <br>
	 lands in the docking bay of the incomplete second Death Star, <br>
	 which the Empire designed to be more powerful than the first. <br>
	 He is greeted by Moff Tiaan Jerjerrod, but demands construction<br>
	  be put back on schedule in order to complete the Death Star on time.<br>
	   Jerjerrod argues that they need more men, but quickly agrees to <br>
	   double their efforts when he learns that the Emperor is coming.<br>
					<br/>
On the Death Star, Emperor Palpatine arrives and praises<br>
 Lord Vader on his efforts in the construction of the Death Star.<br>
  He also senses that Vader craves the continuation of his <br>
  search for his son, Luke. The old Sith Lord assures his apprentice <br>
  that Luke will seek Vader out, that only together would the Sith <br>
  be able to turn Luke to the dark side of the Force, and that <br>
  everything was proceeding as Palpatine has foreseen.<a href="#" target="_BLANK"></a>

				<h3>Battle of Endor</h3>
<p>
	The Rebels enter the heart of the shield generator, only to be <br>
	taken prisoner by the Imperial forces. The fleet emerges from <br>
	hyperspace for the battle, but discovers the shield is still up.<br>
	 As they contemplate their options, the Imperial fleet, which <br>
	 they were led to believe was away, appears and an intense <br>
	 battle begins. Han and the strike team are led out of the bunker <br>
	 by the stormtroopers, but the droids and the Ewoks have already <br>
	 orchestrated the attack on the Empire, and another intense<br>
	  battle commences with the Rebels and Ewoks on one side, <br>
	  the Empire on another. The Emperor shows Luke the full <br>
	  power of the Death Star as the station, now fully operational, <br>
	  destroys one of the Alliance's ships. Meanwhile, on Endor, <br>
	  the battle continues, with casualties <br>
	  (Rebel, stormtrooper, and Ewok) already mounting. Eventually, <br>
	  Han, Leia, and Chewbacca gain access to the bunker.<br>
